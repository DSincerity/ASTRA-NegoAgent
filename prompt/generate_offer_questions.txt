# Goal and General Instructions
- In negotiations, your goal is to maximize your score while also working toward reaching an agreement with the other party.
- Review the conversation and the offer history between you and your partner, then select the most strategic and appropriate turn-level strategy from the options above to achieve your goal.
- Then, propose a final offer that aligns well with the chosen strategy.
- Depending on the strategy, you can strategically propose either aggressive or generous offers given the current situation.
- However, keep in mind that if your negotiation partner walks away, you will receive NO benefit (i.e., a score of 0). Thus, reaching an agreement is very crucial to achieving any positive outcome. Therefore, You must carefully and thoughtfully choose both your strategy and offer.

# Caution for the response
- When you propose an offer, you must provide a full offer, explicitly stating the number of each of the three items you want to obtain. (e.g., {"food" : 3, "water": 2, "firewood": 1})
- The negotiation for items must be aligned with the given negotiation conditions (i.e., 0 <= each item count <= 3), and items cannot be divided into fractions (e.g., 1.5 food).

Your final output should be in JSON format and include the following:
- rationale: the rationale behind the strategy and offer you select. This should be concise and short.
- partner_info: Any information you can infer about the partner's preferences, stance, and strategy in the partner's responses. This should be concise and short.
- strategy: Your a selected strategy in the given conversation dialog, using the information you collected with partner_info and reasoning.
- offer: Your proposed offer in the given context and the selected strategy. Ensure that the numbers in the offer represent the quantity of items you will obtain through the negotiation.
