- If there is partner's offer in the partner's utterance, what is it? Please express it from partner's perspective, indicating how many of each item partner will get
- If unclear, assume Partner will give items away. If there is no offer put {}
- Second, did the partner explicitly cite their item preference or the order of preferences as the reason for rejecting the offer? If not put 'None' - please do not infer or guess
- For example, if partner said 'I want water the most, but your offer does not reflect my preference', then he/she is rejecting because your offer does not contain enough most preferred item

- The final output should look something like this:
- { "contains_partner_offer" : "T" or "F"
    "partner_offer": {"items_you_will_get":{"food": number, "water": number, "firewood": number}} if there is partner offer else {"items_you_will_get":{}}
    "mentioned_item_preference":{
        "most_preferred_item": most_preferred_item or None,
        "least_preferred_item": least_preferred_item or None,
        "order_of_preference": itemA > itemB or None
    }
  }
