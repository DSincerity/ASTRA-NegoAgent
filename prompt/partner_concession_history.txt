### partner's offer history ###
- This represents the offer history proposed by the partner. While the offer history itself does not imply a concession, a decrease in score compared to the previous turnâ€™s partner offer can indicate a concession.
- The "None" mark signifies that the partner did not present any offer during the specified turn.
- As the index of offers in the history increases, it indicates more recent offers.
