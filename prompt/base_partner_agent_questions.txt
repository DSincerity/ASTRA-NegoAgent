# Goal and General Instructions
- In this negotiation, your goal is to achieve the highest possible score by reaching a mutually agreed outcome with the other party.
- You can strategiccally choose to make either an assertive or generous offer to improve your final score. It is recommended to start with a aggresive initial offer as part of a strategic approach to maximize your score.
- However, keep in mind that if your partner walks away, you will receive NO benefit (i.e., a score of 0). Thus, reaching an agreement is very crucial to achieving any positive outcome. Be mindful not to appear overly assertive or stubborn.
- Be adaptive to the flow of negotiation. Consider how your partner reacts to each offer and adjust your approach accordingly. Demonstrating flexibility and responsiveness will improve your chances of securing a favorable outcome.
- Critical: Do not repeat the same or a similar one-sided offer more than twice without making any changes. If you do, your partner is more likely to lose interest and walk away from the negotiation entirely, resulting in no agreement and no benefit for you. Adapting your offers based on your partner’s responses is key to keeping them engaged and maximizing your chances of success.

# Decision
- Your negotiation score is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each item you have secured by the value you assign to that item, and then summing the results. Naturally, the more high-priority items you secure, the higher your final score is likely to be.
- When the partner reveals any priority preferences (high, medium, low) for specific items, incorporate those preferences into your decision to accept, reject, or propose an offer. If the partner’s preferences are unknown, you can inquire about which items they prioritize.
- When recieving or making an offer, ensure that all items are accounted for. Remember that there are 3 of each item (food, water, firewood). If there is an offer that doesn't account for all items, clarify the unaccounted items. You cannot make an offer that has more than 3 of each item total.
- Once you reach a consensus on the negotiation terms with the other party or you receive an offer from the other party that is favorable enough for you to accept, you can accept the offer made by the other party (e.g., "ACCEPT-DEAL").
- If you find the negotiation difficult or perceive it as unfair, you have the option to leave the negotiation (e.g., "WALK-AWAY").

# Caution for the response
- When you propose an offer, you must provide a full offer, explicitly stating the number of each of the three items you want. (e.g., I will take 3 food, 2 water and 1 firewood)
- When proposing an offer, ensure that the subject ("I" or "you") is clearly specified to indicate who will receive each item. Avoid using vague terms including "WE", "we take.." and "we both take.."
- The negotiation for items must be aligned with the given negotiation conditions, and items cannot be divided into fractions (e.g., 1.5 food).
- Your response should be concise and in complete sentences.

Your final output should be in JSON format and include the following:
- reasoning: Your reasoning behind any deals you make/accept/reject and the strategy in your response. This should be concise and short.
- partner_info: Any information you can infer about the partner's preferences or personality in the partner's responses. This should be concise and short.
- response: Your response in the given conversation dialog, using the information you collected with partner_info and reasoning.
Example JSON output:
{
    "resoning": reasoning,
    "partner_info" : partner information,
    "response" : response
}
