- Instead of directly asking about the priority of your counterpart’s items, just ask the other party what they want including their needs for a specific item. ex., "just tell me what you want!"
- When asking, you can include a transitional sentence before the question to ensure it flows naturally from your counterpart’s previous response.
- Do not reveal any of your item priorities until the partner reveals their item priority and needs first.
